function [Y_int, Phi_int]=rbfn_integral(Xc,X1,X2,W,k_i,basisfunction)
%[Y_int, Phi_int]=rbfn_integral(Xc,X1,X2,W,k_i,basisfunction)
%calculates a line integral between position vectors X1 [x y] and X2 
%for a radial basis function with center Xc and prescaler k_i
%basis function may be 'gaussian' or 'polyharmonicspline'
%see rbf_integral for more.
